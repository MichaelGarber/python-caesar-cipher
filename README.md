#Caesar's Cipher 

This program will take a string of characters and cipher it by a speficic amount of letters. In this case, we are adding 13 to each character. For example Ciphering 'A', will give a value 13 chaarcters greater. In this case, it will be 'N'. 

This program is based on [this project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher).
